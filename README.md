NAME
====

ValuePair - Provide an immutable Pair value type

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use ValuePair;

my $a = ValuePair.new("a",42);
my $b = ValuePair.new( key => "a", value => 42);
my $c = ValuePair.new( (a => 42) );

set($a, $b, $c);  # elems == 1
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Raku provides a semi-immutable `Pair` datatype, where the value of a `Pair` object can be a container, and thus mutable. Therefore, a standard `Pair` object is **not** a value type.

The `ValuePair` class provided by this module, is a subclass of `Pair`, and does not allow a mutable value. And thus it can be a value type.

The `.new` method either accepts two positional arguments (key and value), or `key` and `value` named arguments, or an existing `Pair`.
