NAME
====

ValuePair - Provide an immutable Pair value type

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use ValuePair;

my $a = ValuePair.new("a",42);
my $b = ValuePair.new("a",42);

set($a, $b);  # elems == 1
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The functionality provided by this module, will most likely be provided in language level 6.e and higher. If an implementation of ValuePair is already available, loading this module becomes a no-op.

Raku provides a semi-immutable `Pair` datatype, where the value of a Pair object can be a container, and thus mutable. Therefore, a standard Pair is **not** a value type. The `ValuePair` class provided by this module, is a subclass of `Pair`, and does not allow a mutable value. And thus it can be a value type.
